      <description><![CDATA[<div><b>Category:</b> Storm</div>
<div><b>Alert Summary:</b> If you live in an area in far eastern Midwest-Gascoyne and north-eastern Goldfields-Midlands you should take action and stay safe with more thunderstorms to come. 
</div>
<div><b>Content:</b> <p><strong>If you live in an area in far eastern Midwest-Gascoyne and north-eastern Goldfields-Midlands you should take action and stay safe with more thunderstorms to come. </strong></p>
<div>This includes people in Warburton and surrounding areas. </div>
<div>This weather is not unusual for this time of year, but could damage homes and make travel dangerous. </div>
<div> </div>
<div>WHAT TO DO: </div>
<div>DFES advises you to:</div>
<ul><li>If outside find safe shelter away from trees, powerlines, storm water drains and streams.</li>
<li>Close your curtains and blinds, and stay inside away from windows.</li>
<li>Unplug electrical appliances and avoid using landline telephones if there is lightning.</li>
<li>If there is flooding, create your own sandbags by using pillow cases filled with sand and place them around doorways to protect your home.</li>
<li>If boating, swimming or surfing leave the water.</li></ul>
<div>IF DRIVING:</div>
<ul><li>Do not drive into water of unknown depth and current.</li>
<li>Slow down, turn your lights on and keep a safe distance from other drivers.</li>
<li>Be alert and watch for hazards on the road such as fallen powerlines and loose debris.</li>
<li>If it is raining heavily and you cannot see, pull over and park with your hazard lights on until the rain clears.</li>
<li>Take care in areas that have been flooded and be careful driving on gravel roads as surfaces will be slippery and muddy, and vehicles could become bogged.</li></ul>
<div>People are being urged to do what they can to help themselves, if it is safe to do so, before calling the SES for assistance</div>
<div><br />WEATHER DETAILS: </div>
<div>Bureau of Meteorology advised severe thunderstorms are likely to produce damaging winds, large hailstones and heavy rainfall that may lead to flash flooding in the warning area for the next few hours, with the chance of severe thunderstorms easing during the evening. Storms could cause damage to homes and property. If storms develop they are likely to be more intense than usual and dangerous weather conditions may occur in some parts of the warning area.</div>
<div><br />ROAD CLOSURES AND CONDITIONS: </div>
<div><br />Roads have not been closed.</div>
<div>Take extra care on the roads and do not drive into water of unknown depth and current.</div>
<div>Road information may also be available by calling Main Roads WA on 138 138 or visiting <a href="http://www.mainroads.wa.gov.au/">www.mainroads.wa.gov.au</a> or your local Shire.</div>

<div><b>Alert Summary:</b> ​Take action with thunderstorms coming in parts of the Midwest-Gascoyne and Goldfields-Midlands
</div>
<div><b>Content:</b> <p><span style="line-height:1.5em"><strong>If you live in an area near far eastern Midwest-Gascoyne and far northern Goldfields-Midlands you should take action and stay safe with more thunderstorms to come.</strong></span><br /></p>
<p><span style="line-height:1.5em">This</span><span style="line-height:1.5em"> includes people in and around south of Parngurr, east of Carnegie and surrounding areas. </span><br /></p>
<p><span style="line-height:1.5em">This weather is not unusual for this time of year, but could damage homes and make travel dangerous. </span><br /></p>
<p><span style="line-height:1.5em">WHAT TO DO:</span><br /></p>
<p><span style="line-height:1.5em">DFES advises you to:</span><br /></p>
<p>If outside find safe shelter away from trees, powerlines, storm water drains and streams.</p>
<p>Close your curtains and blinds, and stay inside away from windows.</p>
<p>Unplug electrical appliances and avoid using landline telephones if there is lightning.</p>
<p>If there is flooding, create your own sandbags by using pillow cases filled with sand and place them around doorways to protect your home.</p>
<p>If boating, swimming or surfing leave the water.</p>
<p>IF DRIVING:</p>
<p>Do not drive into water of unknown depth and current.</p>
<p>Slow down, turn your lights on and keep a safe distance from other drivers.</p>
<p>Be alert and watch for hazards on the road such as fallen powerlines and loose debris.</p>
<p>If it is raining heavily and you cannot see, pull over and park with your hazard lights on until the rain clears.</p>
<p>Take care in areas that have been flooded and be careful driving on gravel roads as surfaces will be slippery and muddy, and vehicles could become bogged.</p>
<p>People are being urged to do what they can to help themselves, if it is safe to do so, before calling the SES for assistance</p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>WEATHER DETAILS:</p>
<p><span style="line-height:1.5em">Bureau of Meteorology advised Severe thunderstorms are likely to produce large hailstones, damaging winds and heavy rainfall that may lead to flash flooding in the warning during this afternoon. Storms could cause damage to homes and property. If storms develop they are likely to be more intense than usual and dangerous weather conditions may occur in some parts of the warning area.</span><br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>ROAD CLOSURES AND CONDITIONS:</p>
<p><span style="line-height:1.5em">Roads have not been closed.</span><br /></p>
